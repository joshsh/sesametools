Welcome to the SesameTools wiki!
SesameTools is a collection of general-purpose components for use with the [Sesame](http://rdf4j.org) RDF framework.  It includes:

* **SesameTools common utilities**: miscellaneous useful classes
* **CachingSail**: an in-memory cache for RDF data
* **ConstrainedSail**: a Sail implementation which interacts only with given named graphs.  Useful for simple access control.
* **DeduplicationSail**: a Sail implementation which avoids duplicate statements.  For use with triple stores such as AllegroGraph which otherwise allow duplicates.
* [LinkedDataServer](https://github.com/joshsh/sesametools/wiki/LinkedDataServer): a RESTful web service to publish a Sesame data store as Linked Data
* **MappingSail**: a Sail which translates between two URI spaces.  Used by LinkedDataServer.
* **RDFTransactionSail**: a write-only Sail which generates RDF transactions instead of performing per-call updates.  Useful for streaming RDF data as described [here](http://arxiv.org/abs/1011.3595)
* **ReadOnlySail**: a read-only Sail implementation
* **ReplaySail**: a pair of Sail implementations which allow Sail operations to be first recorded to a log file, then reproduced from the log file
* **RepositorySail**: a Sail implementation which wraps a Repository object.  This is essentially the inverse of Sesame's [SailRepository](http://docs.rdf4j.org/javadoc/latest/org/eclipse/rdf4j/repository/sail/SailRepository.html)
* **Sesamize**: command-line tools for Sesame
* **URI Translator**: a utility which runs SPARQL-1.1 Update queries against a Repository to convert URIs between different prefixes
* **WriteOnlySail**: a write-only Sail implementation

For projects which use Maven, SesameTools snapshots and release packages can be imported by adding configuration like the following to the project's POM:

```xml
        <dependency>
            <groupId>net.fortytwo.sesametools</groupId>
            <artifactId>linked-data-server</artifactId>
            <version>1.10</version>
        </dependency>
```
